# TwoFishEncryption
# Overview
This repository contains the Verilog implementation of the Twofish encryption and decryption algorithm on an FPGA. Twofish is a symmetric key block cipher that operates on 128-bit blocks with key sizes of 128, 192, or 256 bits, however the given implemetaiton works for 128 bits key. The design is optimized for FPGA hardware and provides a practical example of implementing a modern cryptographic algorithm on a programmable logic device.

The project was developed as part of the ES204 Digital Systems course.

# Files

Almost all the files in encryption and decryption process remains same except the FuncF_out and the top module that intigerates all modules to perform final task

- encrypt_out.v / decrypt_out.v – Final output processing module, managing ciphertext/plaintext formatting after encryption rounds.

- encrypt_testbench.v – Testbench module simulating the entire encryption pipeline for functional verification.

- input_whitening.v – Handles input whitening step by XORing plaintext with the round of subkeys.

- FuncF_out.v / FuncF_out_decryption.v – Manages output logic from the F-function, preparing data for further processing in the encryption round.

- F_function.v – Implements the F-function core of Twofish, combining G-functions and key mixing for round operations.

- G_Function.v – Realizes the G-function, applying key-dependent S-boxes followed by MDS matrix multiplication.

- pht_32bit.v – Implements 32-bit pseudo-Hadamard transform (PHT) used in the key mixing process and rounds .

- mds.v – Implements the MDS matrix used for diffusion in the G-function of the cipher.

- multi.v – Finite field multiplier, used for MDS matrix computations and other algebraic operations.

- Sbox.v – Constructs dynamic S-boxes using Q permutations and key material, essential for non-linearity.

- Q0.v – Describes the fixed Q0 permutation box, a non-linear byte substitution used in S-box generation.

- Q1.v – Implements the Q1 permutation box, another component for dynamically generating Twofish S-boxes.

- H_Function.v – Defines the H-function for key-dependent transformation in key scheduling and encryption.

- Mat_Multi.v – Performs finite field matrix multiplication, used S0, S1 creation.


# FPGA Configuration

The source code mostly uses structral coding facilitating easy adaptation to different FPGA boards. The top-level module seamlessly integrates encryption/decryption logic with key scheduling. To use the design on a specific FPGA board, users should modify the I/O ports accordingly.

For communication, we attempted to implement UART. While the TX (transmit) functionality works reliably—enabling successful data transmission to a PC—the RX (receive) module could not be completed successfully. As a workaround, we stored multiple plaintext–key-cyphertext pairs as internal registers within the design. Users can interact with the system by manually selecting a specific pair through FPGA switches. The corresponding ciphertext/plaintext (depending on encryption or decryption) is then transmitted to the PC via the working UART TX line.

Additionally, since the UART RX functionality remains incomplete, we have also provided an alternative implementation using FPGA switches and LEDs for I/O interaction. This version enables users to select inputs and view outputs directly on the FPGA board, and the associated files for this implementation are included here.

# Challenges Faced

- **UART RX Implementation Failure:**  
  While we aimed to establish full UART communication, we encountered issues with the RX (receiver) module. Despite successful transmission (TX) of data from FPGA to PC, the RX path couldn't be reliably established. As a workaround, we stored multiple (plaintext, key) pairs in registers and allowed the user to select a pair via input to be transmitted over TX to the PC.

- **Modular Design Integration:**  
  Combining all modules (key schedule, S-boxes, matrix multipliers, etc.) into a coherent top-level system without signal mismatches or simulation deadlocks took multiple debugging cycles.

- **Galois Field Arithmetic Complexity:**  
  Implementing Galois Field multiplication posed a significant challenge. Careful reference to research papers and existing implementations was necessary to validate our approach.

- **Intermediate Value Verification:**  
 Debugging internal states of the encryption algorithm in hardware was non-trivial. The reference materials lacked detailed explanation of the complete logic, so we had to cross-verify every intermediate value with a Python implementation to ensure correctness at each stage of the pipeline.
